An investigation into use of neural networks for hedging equity options. Attempts also to model transaction costs / slippage to gain an edge over the Black-Scholes solution.

Neural network uses Keras and the code is adapted from examples given on a machine learning course by Spyridon Pougkakiotis at King's College London.
