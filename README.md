Work in Progress

Neural network code is adapted from a Machine Learning lecture series given by Spyridon Pougkakiotis at King's College London.

An investigation into use of neural networks for hedging equity options. The network appears able to learn Black-Scholes hedging strategy but I would like to add modelling of transaction costs / slippage to gain an edge over the Black-Scholes solution.
